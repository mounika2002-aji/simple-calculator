Q2.Suppose you have a dataset containing monthly sales data for a company,and you want
   to splint this data into quarterly reports for analysis and reporting purposes.

input:
 monthly_sales = np.array([120, 135, 148, 165, 180, 155, 168, 205, 198, 210, 225])


import numpy as np

# Monthly sales data for the company
monthly_sales = np.array([120, 135, 148, 165, 180, 155, 168, 205, 198, 210, 225])

# Reshape the array into quarters (3 months per quarter)
quarters = monthly_sales.reshape(-1, 3)

# If there are months left over, we need to handle the last quarter
if len(monthly_sales) % 3 != 0:
    last_quarter = monthly_sales[-(len(monthly_sales) % 3):]
    quarters = np.vstack([quarters, last_quarter])

# Print out the quarterly sales data
print("Quarterly Sales Data:")
for i, quarter in enumerate(quarters, start=1):
    print(f"Quarter {i}: {quarter}")
